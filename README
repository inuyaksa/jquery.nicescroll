Nicescroll as a Greasemonkey plugin: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/119910


Nicescroll (as nice scroll for browsers) is a jquery (since 1.5) plugin, for nice scrollbars with a very similar ios/mobile style.
It supports DIVs, IFrames and document page (body) scrollbars.
Compatible with desktop browser: Firefox 4+, Chrome 5+, Safari 4+ (win/mac), Opera 10+, IE 6+. (all A-grade browsers)
Compatible with mobile device: iPad/iPhone/iPod, Android 2.2+, Blackberry phones and Playbook (WebWorks/Table OS), Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. 
So you have scrollable divs with momentum for iPad 4+ and you have consistent scrollable areas for all desktop and mobile platforms.

Sexy zoom feature, you can "zoom-in" the content of any nicescroll'ed div. Nice to use and nice to see, all the content of the div in fullscreen mode. It works on desktop (double click on div) either in mobile/touch devices using pinch gesture.

On modern browsers hardware accelerated scrolling has implemented.
Using animationFrame for a smoothest and cpu-saving scrolling. (when browser supports)

Only vertical scrollbars supported in this version. (horizotal support on version 3 soon)

Warning for IE6 users (why do you uses IE6 yet? Please updgrade to a more stable and modern browser), some feature can't work for limitation of the browser. Document (body) scrollbars can't appears, old (native browser) one is used. Some issues with IFrame scrolling.


* FEATURES

- simple installation and activation, it works with NO modification of your code. (some exceptions can happen, so you can write to me)
- very stylish scrollbars, with no occupation on your window (original browser scrollbars need some of page space and reduces window/div usable width)
- you can style main document scrollbar (body) too!! (not all script implements this feature)
- on all browsers you can scroll: dragging the cursor, mouse wheel (speed customizable), keyboard navigation (cursor keys, pagup/down keys, home/end keys)
- scroll is smooth (as modern tablet browsing), speed is customizable
- zoom feature
- hardware accelerated scroll (where available)
- animation frame support for smoth scrolling and cpu-saving
- dragging scroll mode with scrolling momentum (as touch device)
- tested for all major browsers desktop and mobile versions
- support for touch devices
- support for multi-input devices (IE10 with MSPointer)
- compatible with many other browsers, including IE6, Safari on Mac and WP7 Mango!
- very customizable aspect of bar
- native scroll events are working yet
- fully integrated with jQuery
- compatibile with jQuery UI, jQuery Touch, jQuery Mobile


* DEPENDENCIES
It's a plugin for the jquery framework, you need to include jquery in your scripts.
From 1.5.x version and on. (you can try with 1.4.2+ also)


* INSTALLATION
Put loading script tag after jquery script tag and loading the zoom image in the same folder of the script:

<script src="jquery.nicescroll.js"></script>

* HOW TO USE

Recall ALWAYS in (document) ready statement.

$(document).ready(
  function() {  
    $("html").niceScroll();
  }

2. Instance with object returned:

var nice = false;
$(document).ready(
  function() {  
    nice = $("html").niceScroll();
  }
);

3. Style a DIV and chage cursor color:

$(document).ready(
  function() {  
    $("#thisdiv").niceScroll({cursorcolor:"#00F"});
  }
);

4. DIV with "wrapper", formed by two divs, the first is the vieport, the latter is the content:

$(document).ready(
  function() {
    $("#viewportdiv").niceScroll("#wrapperdiv",{cursorcolor:"#00F"});
  }
);

5. Get nicescroll object:
